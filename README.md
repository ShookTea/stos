# StOS

### Prerequisites

1. GCC Cross-Compiler - you can find installation instructions in the 
  ([OsDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler))
    - used commands for building are: `i686-elf-gcc`, `i686-elf-as`
2. Grub - for building bootable ISO files, without having to write a bootloader
    - used commands are: `grub-file`, `grub-mkrescue`
3. Qemu virtual machine - for launching the OS somewhere
    - used command is: `qemu-system-i386`

### Basic development tools

Running just `make all` should build a bootable `build/stos.iso` file.
Running `make qemu` will both create the bootable ISO file and immediately
launch the Qemu virtual machine with that ISO plugged into a CD-ROM.

To improve how CLang handles the code (errors, "Go to definition" for libraries)
you can install `bear` package and then run `bear -- make qemu`. It will create
a `compile_commands.json` file (which is added to `.gitignore`) containing
arguments for compiler that is respected by CLang.
